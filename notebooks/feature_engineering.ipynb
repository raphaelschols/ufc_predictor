{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Creating Training Data for UFC Fight Predictions  \n","\n","This notebook focuses on building a **clean and structured training dataset** for UFC fight predictions by integrating multiple data sources. The main steps include:\n","\n","##### **1. Constructing the Baseline Dataset**  \n","   - Generate a **unique bout dataset**, ensuring each fight is represented only once.  \n","   - Standardize fighter names, event details, and match outcomes.  \n","\n","##### **2. Creating a Fighter Statistics Dataset**  \n","   - Extract **fighter-level statistics** for each available year.  \n","   - Compute **historical performance metrics** such as win streaks, win percentages, and fight history summaries.  \n","\n","##### **3. Merging and Aligning the Data**  \n","   - **Cross-join events by date** to match fight records across different data sources.  \n","   - Apply **string matching techniques (token set ratio)** to align event names with high accuracy.  \n","   - Use **fighter-opponent string similarity** to ensure correct fight mappings.  \n","   - Merge **fighter statistics** with fight-level data to enrich the dataset.  \n","\n","#### **4. Feature Engineering for Model Training**  \n","   - Compute **rolling averages** of fight statistics to capture historical trends.  \n","   - Extract **physical attributes (height, reach, age)** from fighter profiles.  \n","   - Ensure **no data leakage** by adjusting win/loss and rolling averages columns to reflect only prior information.  \n","\n","The resulting dataset serves as a **training-ready dataset**, combining Wikipedia fight records with UFC statistics. This structured data can be used to train predictive models, such as machine learning classifiers, to forecast fight outcomes. ðŸš€  "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import json\n","import os\n","import re\n","from thefuzz import fuzz"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# get the file path\n","def get_file_path(folder, file_name):\n","    return os.path.dirname(os.getcwd()) + \"\\\\\" + folder + \"\\\\\" + file_name"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Load all files "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Event Data:      type                                          event_url  \\\n","0  event  http://www.ufcstats.com/event-details/9ca265df...   \n","1  event  http://www.ufcstats.com/event-details/063649e2...   \n","2  event  http://www.ufcstats.com/event-details/18f5669a...   \n","3  event  http://www.ufcstats.com/event-details/956dcac6...   \n","4  event  http://www.ufcstats.com/event-details/3cf68c1d...   \n","\n","                                event_name  event_date  \\\n","0              UFC 173: Barao vs Dillashaw  2014-05-24   \n","1  UFC Fight Night: Henderson vs Dos Anjos  2014-08-23   \n","2          UFC Fight Night: Kattar vs. Ige  2020-07-15   \n","3                                 DWCS 6.3  2022-08-09   \n","4          UFC 243: Whittaker vs. Adesanya  2019-10-05   \n","\n","                               event_location    event_key  \n","0                      Las Vegas, Nevada, USA  67220140524  \n","1                        Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA  23820140823  \n","2  Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates  12720200715  \n","3                      Las Vegas, Nevada, USA  22820220809  \n","4              Melbourne, Victoria, Australia  29720191005  \n","Event Card Data:           type                                          fight_url  \\\n","0  event_card  http://www.ufcstats.com/fight-details/edcb573f...   \n","1  event_card  http://www.ufcstats.com/fight-details/2f6b63e8...   \n","2  event_card  http://www.ufcstats.com/fight-details/c3e3d5ef...   \n","3  event_card  http://www.ufcstats.com/fight-details/f9a59f7c...   \n","4  event_card  http://www.ufcstats.com/fight-details/164eb907...   \n","\n","                                           event_url     fighter_name  \\\n","0  http://www.ufcstats.com/event-details/9ca265df...
